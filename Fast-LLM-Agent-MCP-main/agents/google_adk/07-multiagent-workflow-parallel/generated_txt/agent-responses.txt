Test Prompt:
```bash
I want to research about the "LLM Agents"
```

Topic_setter agent gives following response:
```json
{"subtopic_1": "Definition and architecture of LLM Agents", 
"subtopic_2": "Applications and use cases of LLM Agents", 
"subtopic_3": "Challenges and future directions for LLM Agents"}
```

Research Agent1 gives response:
```json
LLM agents face challenges including hallucinations, limited memory and 
context windows, and struggles with real-time decision-making and complex 
calculations. Future directions involve developing hybrid systems 
combining LLMs with deterministic tools for precision tasks, improving 
continuous learning and scalability, and enhancing multi-agent 
collaboration and ethical considerations.
```

Research Agent2:
```json
LLM agents are advanced AI systems that use large language models (LLMs) 
to reason through problems, create plans, and execute tasks with the help 
of various tools, going beyond simple text generation to handle complex, 
multi-step assignments autonomously. Their architecture typically includes 
a core LLM (the "brain"), memory modules for retaining context, tools for 
external interactions (like APIs or databases), and planning components to 
break down complex tasks and determine actions.
```

Research Agent3:
```json
LLM agents are utilized across various industries and applications due to 
their ability to understand language, perform complex tasks, and interact 
with external tools and data sources. Key applications include enhancing 
customer service through personalized interactions and 24/7 support, and 
streamlining internal operations such as HR and IT support. They also play 
a significant role in automating tasks like market analysis, financial 
reporting, supply chain management, and compliance checks by gathering and 
evaluating vast amounts of data. Furthermore, LLM agents are valuable in 
software development for generating code and assisting with debugging, and 
in research and development for hypothesis testing and data analysis.

Conclusion
LLM agents represent a significant advancement in AI, enabling autonomous 
execution of complex, multi-step tasks by integrating LLMs with planning, 
memory, and external tools. While offering vast potential across diverse 
applications from customer service to software development, they currently 
grapple with issues like hallucinations and computational limitations. 
Future developments aim to overcome these challenges through hybrid 
architectures, enhanced learning capabilities, and robust ethical frameworks.
