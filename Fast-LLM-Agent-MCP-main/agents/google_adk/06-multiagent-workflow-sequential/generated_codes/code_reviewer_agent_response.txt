- Game Over Event Handling: The event loop for quitting (for event in pygame.event.get():) inside the if game_over: block is problematic. pygame.event.get() consumes all events in the queue. Calling it twice (once in the main loop, once in the game_over block) means the inner loop might miss events already processed by the outer loop or only catch events that occurred after the outer loop for that frame. It's better to handle all events in the main loop and apply conditions based on game_over. For example, change if event.key == pygame.K_q: within the inner loop to elif event.key == pygame.K_q and game_over: in the main event loop.
- Magic Numbers/Constants: Many literal values (e.g., 50 for shuttle size, 7 for speed, 10 for score, 1000 for meteor spawn time) are used directly in the code. Defining these as named constants at the top would improve readability, make them easier to modify, and reduce potential errors.
- Player Vertical Movement Limit: The SCREEN_HEIGHT // 2 boundary for the player's vertical movement is an arbitrary "magic number". If this is a design choice, consider making it a named constant (e.g., PLAYER_TOP_BOUND) for clarity.
- Visuals: While functional for a prototype, the game uses simple colored squares. In a more complete game, consider loading actual image assets for the shuttle, meteors, and bullets for a better visual experience.
