## 🔥 10 Advanced AWS Multi-Account & Multi-Region Interview Scenarios

---

### ✅ **1. EC2 Backup Strategy Across Regions and Accounts**

**🎯 Scenario:**

You need to take nightly backups of critical EC2 instances (in Account A, ap-south-1) and store encrypted AMIs in a different region and account (Account B, us-east-1) for DR purposes.

**🛠️ Solution:**

- Use **EC2 CreateImage API** with `-no-reboot`.
- Copy AMI using `copy-image` to `us-east-1`.
- Share AMI across accounts using:
    - `modify-image-attribute` for `launchPermission`
    - Share attached encrypted EBS snapshots using **KMS grants**
- Use a **Lambda** in Account A triggered by **EventBridge** daily, with cross-account IAM role in B.

**🧩 Tip:**

Use **resource tags** and AWS Backup vaults for governance and cost tracking.

### ✅ **2. Cross-Account Access to S3 with SSE-KMS Encryption**

**🎯 Scenario:**

Lambda in Account A (us-east-1) writes logs to an S3 bucket in Account B (ap-south-1) encrypted with a KMS key.

**🛠️ Solution:**

- Grant the Lambda’s role in Account A permission for:
    - `s3:PutObject`
    - `kms:Encrypt` on the KMS key
- Add **bucket policy** in Account B allowing Principal from A.
- KMS key in Account B must include:
    
    ```json
   
    "Principal": {
      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<AccountA>:role/<LambdaRole>"
    }
    
    ```
    

**🧩 Pitfall:**

KMS keys are **regional**, so ensure encryption and object location match.

### ✅ **3. Private VPC Communication Between Accounts & Regions**

**🎯 Scenario:**

You want private EC2-to-EC2 communication between Account A (us-east-1) and Account B (ap-south-1).

**🛠️ Options:**

1. **Inter-Region VPC Peering**
2. **Transit Gateway with Inter-Region Peering**
3. **Site-to-Site VPN over Direct Connect (high performance)**

**🧩 Best Practice:**

- Ensure non-overlapping CIDRs
- Update route tables and SGs/NACLs
- For security: use **flow logs + GuardDuty** across accounts

---

### ✅ **4. Route53 Multi-Region Failover With Health Checks**

**🎯 Scenario:**

Your app is deployed in **us-east-1** and **ap-south-1** in two different accounts. Users should be routed to the healthy region only.

**🛠️ Solution:**

- Use **Route53 failover routing policy** with:
    - Health check on the primary region’s ALB
    - Secondary as failover
- Host the public domain in a **central Route53 account**
- ALBs in other accounts use **alias records**

**🧩 Bonus:**

Use **Route53 Resolver** if hybrid DNS is needed (on-prem ↔ AWS).

---

### ✅ **5. Load Balancer Sharing Across Accounts**

**🎯 Scenario:**

You have an ALB in Account A, but apps in Account B need to expose APIs behind this LB.

**🛠️ Solution:**

- Share ALB with **Resource Access Manager (RAM)**.
- Use **Target-type = IP** in ALB listener rules.
- Register **private IPs** of ECS/EC2 in Account B.

**🧩 Gotcha:**

- Ensure SG in Account A allows inbound from B.
- Monitor with **Access Logs → S3** and **CloudWatch metrics**.

---

### ✅ **6. ASG Across Regions with Dynamic Scaling and HA**

**🎯 Scenario:**

You want Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) in **us-west-1** and **ap-south-1**, in two different accounts, to scale independently based on CPU and queue depth.

**🛠️ Solution:**

- Define identical **Launch Templates** per region/account.
- Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** with:
    - CPU thresholds
    - Custom metrics (e.g., SQS queue depth)
- Use **Parameter Store or Secrets Manager** to manage common config.

**🧩 Governance Tip:**

Use **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** to control ASG launch types across accounts.

---

### ✅ **7. IAM Role Trust Between Accounts for DevOps Pipelines**

**🎯 Scenario:**

Your DevOps account needs to deploy EC2-based apps into Account B’s environment (QA, Prod, etc.).

**🛠️ Solution:**

- In Account B:
    
    ```json

    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<DevOpsAccount>:role/<CodeDeployRole>"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    
    ```
    
- In DevOps Pipeline, use `sts:AssumeRole` in deploy phase.

**🧩 Tools:**

- Use **IAM Access Analyzer** to audit trust boundaries.
- Enforce **least privilege** via inline policies.

---

### ✅ **8. Lambda@Edge Across Regions**

**🎯 Scenario:**

You want a Lambda@Edge to execute globally (e.g., user auth) but manage it centrally from ap-south-1.

**🛠️ Solution:**

- Lambda@Edge must be deployed in **us-east-1** only.
- Code is replicated globally via CloudFront.
- Triggered on:
    - `viewer-request`, `origin-request`, etc.
- Use **central pipeline** in another region to package and deploy via `aws lambda publish-version`.

**🧩 Pro Tip:**

Set **CloudWatch logs** for regional Lambda@Edge executions via StackSets if needed.

---

### ✅ **9. IAM Cross-Account EC2 Session Manager (SSM)**

**🎯 Scenario:**

Your security team in Account A wants to securely access EC2 in Account B (no SSH, no bastion).

**🛠️ Solution:**

- EC2 in Account B should:
    - Attach IAM role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`
    - Have SSM agent installed and internet/NAT access
- Create **cross-account IAM role** in Account A with SSM permissions
- Use **AWS CLI with AssumeRole** to connect via `aws ssm start-session`

**🧩 Bonus:**

Enable **session logging** to S3 + CloudTrail for full audit.

---

### ✅ **10. Multi-Account Cross-Region Disaster Recovery Drill**

**🎯 Scenario:**

Your web app runs in **Account A (primary)** in **us-east-1** and needs to failover to **Account B** in **ap-south-1** during DR drill.

**🛠️ Strategy:**

- Use **Route53 failover** or **AWS Global Accelerator**.
- S3: Enable **Cross-Region Replication**
- EC2: Use AMI + snapshot replication via automation
- ASG: Use launch templates with **pre-baked AMIs**
- RDS: Use **Read Replica** or **Aurora Global DB**

**🧩 Monitoring & Alerts:**

- Use **CloudWatch composite alarms**
- Automate failover with **Lambda + EventBridge**
