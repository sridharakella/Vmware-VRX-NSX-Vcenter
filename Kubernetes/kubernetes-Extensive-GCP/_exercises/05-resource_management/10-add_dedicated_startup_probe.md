# Implementing Dedicated Startup Probes in Kubernetes

## Overview

In this exercise, weâ€™re going to tackle the implementation of dedicated startup probes in Kubernetes. The main goal here is to ensure that our application has a robust way to manage its startup and health checks independently. Before diving into the step-by-step guide, I encourage you to try this out on your own! Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the main steps youâ€™ll need to take:

1. Identify the existing probe implementation and its limitations.
2. Create a dedicated endpoint for startup probes.
3. Update the health check logic to differentiate between startup, readiness, and liveness probes.
4. Build and push the updated Docker image.
5. Verify that the probes work correctly.

Give it a shot! Once youâ€™ve given it your best effort, check out the step-by-step guide below.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Review Current Probes**: Look at your applicationâ€™s current health check endpoints and understand where the bug exists regarding the dual use of the health endpoint for startup and liveness probes.

2. **Add Dedicated Startup Endpoint**: Implement a new endpoint specifically for startup probes. This endpoint should return a simple message (like "OK") to serve as a successful response for startup checks.

3. **Adjust Probe Logic**: Make sure that your applicationâ€™s readiness and liveness probes can operate independently of the startup probe. This means updating the probe configuration in your deployment specs accordingly.

4. **Build the Docker Image**: Navigate to your IDE and run the Docker build command, tagging it appropriately, for example:

   ```
   docker build -t lmacademy/color-api:1.2.1 .
   ```

5. **Push the Docker Image**: Use the Docker push command to upload your newly built image to the repository:

   ```
   docker push lmacademy/color-api:1.2.1
   ```

6. **Test Your Changes**: After everything is set up, deploy your application and ensure that all probes are functioning as intended!

## Conclusion

By setting up dedicated startup probes, you improve the reliability and clarity of your application's health checks in Kubernetes. This exercise reinforces the importance of separating concerns in your probes to ensure that failures in one do not inadvertently affect others. Keep practicing and donâ€™t hesitate to explore other aspects of Kubernetes as you continue your learning journey! ðŸš€
