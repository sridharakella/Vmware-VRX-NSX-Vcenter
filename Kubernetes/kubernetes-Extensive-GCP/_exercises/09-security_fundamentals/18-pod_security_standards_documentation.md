# Pod Security Standards Documentation Review

## Overview

In this exercise, we will explore the Pod Security Standards and learn how to apply them to enhance the security posture of our applications. The goal is to understand the differences between the privileged baseline and restricted standards, and how to comply with them when configuring our Kubernetes containers. Before diving into the detailed guide, I encourage you to take a moment to try implementing the solution yourself! Hereâ€™s a simple summary of the steps to follow:

1. Review the Pod Security Standards documentation, focusing on the baseline and restricted policies.
2. Identify which fields are restricted for Windows pods and general container configurations.
3. Understand the capabilities you can add without violating the security standards.
4. Analyze the restrictions on volume types and privilege escalation in your setup.
5. Apply these insights to enhance the security of your applications.

Ready to give it a go? Let's see what you can come up with before going into the step-by-step guide! ðŸš€

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Access the Documentation**: Start by visiting the Pod Security Standards documentation page. Familiarize yourself with the layout and the types of information provided.
2. **Examine the Baseline and Restricted Policies**: Pay close attention to the differences highlighted in the baseline and restricted standards. Make a note of fields that are restricted for both Windows containers and general containers.

3. **Review Capabilities**: List the capabilities you are allowed to add without violating the security standards. These are critical for ensuring that your containers remain secure while still functional.

4. **Check Volume Restrictions**: Investigate what types of volumes can be created under both the baseline and restricted policies. Focus on any restrictions regarding local volumes and host paths.

5. **Implement Security Measures**: Using the insights you gathered, apply these security measures to your application's configuration. Be sure to document any changes you make for future reference.

## Conclusion

In summary, we learned about the importance of understanding Pod Security Standards and how they serve as a framework for securing our Kubernetes applications. By carefully examining the restrictions on configurations, capabilities, and volumes, we can significantly improve the security posture of our apps. As you continue your learning journey, keep these principles in mind, and don't hesitate to experiment with different configurations. Happy learning! ðŸŒŸ
