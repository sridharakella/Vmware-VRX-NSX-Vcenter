# Kubernetes Fundamentals: Cluster Cleanup

Welcome to this segment on cluster cleanup! In this guide, we'll focus on tidying up your Kubernetes cluster to ensure everything is neat and organized. It's important to manage our resources efficiently so that we can avoid any confusion in the future.

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll learn how to clean up your Kubernetes cluster by removing unnecessary resources. Before diving into the step-by-step guide, here's a quick summary of what you'll be implementing:

1. Identify any existing resources in your cluster (like pods, certificates, roles, etc.).
2. Remove any unwanted resources, either by deleting entire namespaces or specific objects.
3. Optionally, clean up users and contexts if needed.
4. Ensure that your cluster is clear of resources that are no longer in use.

We encourage you to try implementing these steps on your own before checking out the detailed guide. Give it a shot! ðŸš€

## Step-by-Step Guide

Hereâ€™s a straightforward guide to help you clean up your Kubernetes cluster:

1. **Check existing resources**: Use commands like `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl get csr`, etc., to list out all your current resources.
2. **Delete Pods**:
   - Remove your pod definitions by using `kubectl delete -f <pod-definition.yaml>` (adding `--force` if needed).
3. **Delete Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)**:
   - Run `kubectl delete csr <csr-name>` to remove any CSRs present.
4. **Delete Roles and Role Bindings**:
   - If you have specific roles to delete, use `kubectl delete -f <role-binding.yaml>` for each relevant role binding.
5. **Delete Service Accounts**:
   - Similar to roles, delete any service accounts with `kubectl delete -f <service-account.yaml>`.
6. **Remove Namespaces** (if empty):
   - Utilize `kubectl delete namespace <namespace-name>` for namespaces you want to clean up.
7. **Review Users and Contexts**:
   - Decide if you want to keep or delete specific users and contexts from your config.

## Conclusion

Today, we've covered how to efficiently clean up your Kubernetes cluster by removing unnecessary resources. Keeping your cluster tidy is crucial for improved resource management and clarity in future projects. Keep practicing this skill as you'll find it immensely beneficial in your journey with Kubernetes.
