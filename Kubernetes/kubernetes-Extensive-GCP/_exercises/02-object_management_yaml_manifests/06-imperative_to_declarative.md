# Transitioning from Imperative to Declarative in Kubernetes

In this exercise, we're going to explore how to transition from an imperative approach to a declarative approach in Kubernetes.

## Overview

The primary focus will be on using the `kubectl apply` command to manage our resources effectively. Before diving into the step-by-step guide, hereâ€™s a quick summary of what you should aim to implement:

1. Create a pod using the imperative `kubectl create` command.
2. Confirm that the pod is created using `kubectl get pods`.
3. Use the `kubectl apply` command to apply the same pod configuration with the nginx pod file.
4. Check the podâ€™s configuration to verify the presence of the last applied configuration annotation.
5. Optionally, learn how to use the `--save-config` flag for future resource creations.

Take a moment to try implementing these steps on your own before checking out the detailed guide below. Don't hesitate to experiment! ðŸš€

## Step-by-Step Guide

Hereâ€™s a straightforward guide to help you transition your command usage:

1. **Create a Pod**:
   ```bash
   kubectl create -f nginx-pod.yaml
   ```
2. **Check the Created Pod**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

3. **Apply the Configuration**:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
   ```

4. **Verify the Last Applied Configuration**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pod nginx -o yaml
   ```

   Look for the `last-applied-configuration` annotation.

5. **Optionally Use the Save Config Flag**:
   If you didn't use the `--save-config` option during creation, you can still proceed with `kubectl apply` as it will patch the configuration automatically.

6. **Clean Up**:
   Don't forget to delete any objects defined in your configuration files to keep your environment tidy:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f nginx-pod.yaml
   ```

## Conclusion

By moving from imperative commands to using `kubectl apply`, you not only streamline your resource management but also embrace a more declarative way of working with Kubernetes. This transition allows Kubernetes to maintain the last applied configuration for seamless updates. Keep practicing, and donâ€™t hesitate to try out different configurations! Remember, getting comfortable with these commands will make you more proficient in Kubernetes management.
