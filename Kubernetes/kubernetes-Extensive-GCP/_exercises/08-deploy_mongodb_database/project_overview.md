# Project Overview: Color API and MongoDB Integration

Welcome to our project focused on persisting data from our Color API! ðŸŒˆ In this exercise, we'll be implementing a solution that connects our Color API to a MongoDB database, allowing color information to be stored and retrieved efficiently.

### Overview

Before diving into the detailed steps, hereâ€™s a high-level summary of what youâ€™ll be working on:

1. Deploy a MongoDB Stateful Set with a headless service.
2. Create a persistent volume claim for dynamic volume provisioning in Minikube.
3. Set up necessary config maps and secrets for database connection.
4. Update the Color API code to handle database connections through environment variables.
5. Utilize MongoDB for database interactions in the Color API.
6. Extend the REST API to include relevant paths for color data management.
7. Test the API using a NodePort service to interact with external users.

Take a moment to implement this solution on your own! You might be surprised at how much you can achieve without immediate guidance.
