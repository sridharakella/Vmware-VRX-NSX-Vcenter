# Creating Persistent Volumes and Stateful Sets in Kubernetes

## Overview

In this guide, we will dive into the process of creating Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Stateful Sets in Kubernetes to effectively manage stateful applications. Before we jump into the step-by-step instructions, hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you should aim to implement:

1. SSH into your MiniKube and create directories for your persistent volumes.
2. Configure the permissions for those directories.
3. Create a YAML file to define your persistent volumes.
4. Apply the configuration to create the persistent volumes in your cluster.
5. Prepare to define your Stateful Set to utilize these persistent volumes.

We encourage you to try implementing these steps yourself before checking the detailed guide that follows. Let's take it onâ€”ready when you are! ðŸ’ª

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **SSH into MiniKube**:
   - Access your MiniKube environment.
2. **Create Directories**:
   - Inside your `mount` directory, create three folders: `ss-0`, `ss-1`, and `ss-2`.
3. **Set Permissions**:

   - Change the permissions of these directories to `777` to ensure they are writable.

4. **Create Persistent Volume YAML**:

   - Open your preferred IDE and create a new directory named `stateful_sets`.
   - In this directory, create a file called `PVs.yaml` to define your persistent volumes.
   - Copy and paste the necessary configuration from a local volume example, modifying the names to `stateful set zero`, `stateful set one`, and `stateful set two`, respectively.

5. **Apply Persistent Volumes**:

   - Use the command `kubectl apply -f PVs.yaml` in the terminal to create the persistent volumes.
   - Verify that all persistent volumes are in the "available" status.

6. **Prepare for Stateful Set Definition**:
   - Get ready to define and apply your Stateful Set, which you will do in the next steps.

## Conclusion

In this session, we explored how to create Persistent Volumes and set up Stateful Sets in Kubernetes. These concepts are crucial for managing stateful applications effectively, providing stable identities and storage for your Pods. Keep practicing these techniques, as mastering them will greatly enhance your Kubernetes skills. Happy coding! ðŸš€
