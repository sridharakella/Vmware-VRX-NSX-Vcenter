# Exploring the External Name Service in Kubernetes

Welcome! In this guide, weâ€™ll dive into the External Name Service in Kubernetes, a handy way to manage DNS resolutions for services. Before we jump into the detailed steps, I encourage you to take a shot at implementing the exercise on your own. It's a great way to learn! Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what youâ€™ll be doing:

## Overview

In this exercise, you will create an External Name Service in Kubernetes. The service resolves to an external DNS name, enabling your applications to interact with external resources.

Here are the main steps:

1. Create a new YAML file for your External Name service, calling it `Google_extname.yaml`.
2. Define the service type as `ExternalName` and set up the DNS name in the spec.
3. Apply the configuration to your Kubernetes cluster.
4. Create a traffic generator pod to test your setup.
5. Execute a request to the service and observe the response.

Try to implement these steps before checking out the detailed guide below! ðŸš€

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create the YAML File**: Open your IDE and create a file named `Google_extname.yaml`. Include the following basic structure:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-external-svc
   spec:
     type: ExternalName
     externalName: <your-dns-name-here> # Use a DNS name without http/https
   ```

2. **Apply the Configuration**: Run the following command in your terminal to apply your service definition:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f Google_extname.yaml
   ```

3. **Verify the Service**: Check if your service is created successfully by listing the services in your cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl get services
   ```

4. **Create a Traffic Generator Pod**: Now, create another YAML file called `traffic-generator.yaml` to set up a simple pod that you can use to send requests:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: traffic-generator
   spec:
     containers:
       - name: traffic-generator
         image: appropriate/curl # Change this to a suitable image
         command: ['/bin/sh', '-c', 'sleep 3600']
   ```

5. **Start the Pod**: Apply this configuration too:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f traffic-generator.yaml
   ```

6. **Access the Pod**: Use an interactive terminal to access your traffic generator pod:

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it traffic-generator -- /bin/sh
   ```

7. **Send a Request**: Inside the pod, use `curl` to call your external service:

   ```bash
   curl my-external-svc
   ```

   Observe the response, which should show you the output from the external DNS.

8. **Clean Up**: Once you are done, donâ€™t forget to delete the resources you created:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f Google_extname.yaml
   kubectl delete -f traffic-generator.yaml
   ```

## Conclusion

Today, we explored the External Name Service in Kubernetes and how to set it up. We went through defining the service, testing it with a simple pod, and ensuring a cleanup after the tests. Remember that while you may not use External Name Services as often as other types, they can be quite beneficial for specific use cases.

Keep experimenting and learning! Every small implementation enhances your skills and knowledge. Happy coding! ðŸŒŸ
