# Implementing a Traffic Generator and Color API in Kubernetes

## Overview

In this exercise, we're diving into Kubernetes, focusing on creating a Color API deployment and a traffic generator pod. The aim is to familiarize ourselves with services and communication in a Kubernetes environment. Before jumping into the step-by-step guide, here's a quick summary of what you'll try to implement:

1. Create a new directory for your Kubernetes YAML files.
2. Write a deployment YAML file for the Color API, including replicas and container specifications.
3. Apply the deployment to create the Color API pods.
4. Create a YAML file for the traffic generator pod.
5. Apply the traffic generator pod and ensure it communicates with the Color API pods.

Take a moment to work through these steps on your own. It's a great opportunity to reinforce your learning! ðŸš€

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a New Directory**:

   - Open your terminal and create a clean directory for your Kubernetes files.

2. **Create the Color API Deployment**:

   - In your IDE, create a file named `color_api_deployment.yaml`.
   - Write the deployment YAML, specifying the API version, kind, metadata (name and labels), replica count, and container settings.
   - Don't forget to match the pod labels with the deployment labels.

3. **Apply the Deployment**:

   - Run `kubectl apply -f color_api_deployment.yaml` in your terminal.
   - Check the created pods using `kubectl get pods`.

4. **Clean Up (Optional)**:

   - If you have existing pods from earlier tests, delete them to avoid confusion.

5. **Create the Traffic Generator Pod**:

   - In your IDE, create another file called `traffic_generator.yaml`.
   - Write the pod definition YAML, specifying the API version, kind, metadata (name and labels), and container settings with the arguments for traffic generation.

6. **Apply the Traffic Generator Pod**:

   - Run `kubectl apply -f traffic_generator.yaml` in your terminal.
   - Use `kubectl logs -f <traffic-generator-pod-name>` to follow the traffic generator logs.

7. **Test Connectivity**:

   - You can test the resilience by deleting one of the Color API pods and observing the traffic generatorâ€™s behavior.

8. **Use Cluster IP Services (Future Steps)**:
   - Explore how to create a Cluster IP service for your Color API to facilitate stable communication between pods in your next exercises.

## Conclusion

Today, we explored the fundamentals of creating a Color API deployment and a traffic generator in Kubernetes. This exercise has provided you with a solid understanding of how pods communicate with each other and the significance of maintaining stable IP addresses using services. Keep practicing these concepts to strengthen your grasp of Kubernetes. Weâ€™ll continue building on this foundation in the next sessions!
