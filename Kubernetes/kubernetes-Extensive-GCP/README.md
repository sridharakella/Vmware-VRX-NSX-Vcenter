Welcome everyone! I'm very happy to see you around, and I hope this repository brings lots of value for those learning more about Docker and Kubernetes. Make sure to check the link above for a great discount on the course in Udemy, where I not only provide theoretical explanations around all the concepts here, but also go in details through the entire coding of the examples in this repository.

Here are a few tips for you to best navigate the contents of this repository:

1. The folder `_exercises` contains practical steps for you to try to implement the hands-on labs we go through throughout the course. They are organized based on the Kubernetes sections of the course, so you can easily match the folder and the section by title, as well as the exercise file and the corresponding hands-on lab video in the course.
2. Each section in the course has one or more folders associated with it, and each folder contains all the files and code for the respective topic. Sometimes, sections have more than one folder, but it should be very straightforward to identify the correct folder based on the lecture titles, as I tried to keep the naming as consistent as possible.
