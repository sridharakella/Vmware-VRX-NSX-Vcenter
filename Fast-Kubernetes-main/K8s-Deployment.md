## LAB: K8s Deployment - Scale Up/Down - Bash Connection - Port Forwarding

This scenario shows:
- how to create deployment,
- how to get detail information of deployment and pods,
- how to scale up and down of deployment,
- how to connect to the one of the pods with bash,
- how to show ethernet interfaces of the pod and ping other pods,
- how to forward ports to see nginx server page using browser.

### Steps

- Run minikube  (in this scenario, K8s runs on WSL2- Ubuntu 20.04) ("minikube start")

- Create Yaml file (deployment1.yaml) in your directory and copy the below definition into the file.
- File: https://github.com/omerbsezer/Fast-Kubernetes/blob/main/labs/deployment/deployment1.yaml

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: firstdeployment
  labels:
    team: development
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:                        # deployment selector
    matchLabels:                   # deployment selects "app:frontend" pods, monitors and traces these pods 
      app: frontend                # if one of the pod is killed, K8s looks at the desire state (replica:3), it recreats another pods to protect number of replicas
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:                      # pod labels, if the deployment selector is same with these labels, deployment follows pods that have these labels         
        app: frontend              # key: value        
    spec:                                   
      containers:
      - name: nginx                
        image: nginx:latest        # image download from DockerHub
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80        # open following ports
```

- Create deployment and list the deployment's pods:

- Delete one of the pod, then K8s automatically creates new pod:

- Scale up to 5 replicas:

- Scale down to 3 replicas:

- Get more information about pods (ip, node):

- Connect one of the pod with bash:

- To install ifconfig, run: "apt update", "apt install net-tools"
- To install ping, run: "apt install iputils-ping"
- Show ethernet interfaces:

- Ping other pods:

- Port-forward from one of the pod to host (8085:80):

- On the browser, goto http://127.0.0.1:8085/

- Delete deployment:
